Origin of Species" as Technical Writing
We know species can vary over time: humans have been breeding animals for profit and pleasure 
since the dawn of civilization. 
We see how "the whole body of English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size 
the parent Arab stock," or how "how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early 
maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country." 
We also know that species will repopulate at a rate of geometric growth, until their numbers they 
consume all available resources. All species can reproduce faster than their members die off. The 
only thing keeping them in check is the limited number of resources. 
With only a limited number of resources, it is those variants of a species that are most 
successfully suited to extracting resources for survival that survive - and are around to breed 
the most. 
Natural selection takes place not only within species traits, but also across different species 
competing for the same resources. Those better at obtaining resources through new genetic traits, 
will, through time, overpower others. And there is a compound effect, the greater the diversity 
within the species, the more likely that species will be able to adapt that traits that make it better 
compete for resources. Those less able to compete become rarer, and, over time, go extinct. 
Natural selection is ruthlessly efficient. "Natural selection is continually trying to economize in 
every part of the organism," Darwin tells us. Any diminution of a trait that does not hinder the 
survival of the species will quickly be seized upon and capitalized. This may explain why there 
are very few species that thrive across different climates. 
Response to Criticism 
To this day, "Origin of Species" has generated a fair amount of skepticism, of which Darwin 
anticipated 
Chief among the criticisms is one of missing evidence: If natural selection modified all the 
species why don't we see more evidence of these earlier, or transitional, variations in the fossil 
record? He did admit that the geological record is spotty. "The crust of the earth is a vast 
museum; but the natural collections have been imperfectly made, and only at long intervals of 
time," he wrote. 
We do not have a record of transitional species, as they do not live for long, after the favorable 
variation of the species takes hold, and quickly comes to dominate. 
THOUGHTS:

Darwin piles on example after example variation under domestication, drawing from Chinese 
encyclopaedias, farmers and cattlemen, hobbyist animal breeders, gardeners, the Bible, even 
deriving them first-hand by breeding pigeons and studying the survival of weeds in a small field. 
Sometimes a piece of writing so closely describes the truth, that it itself becomes the truth. 
Charles Darwin's " On the Origin of Species," first published in 1859, made its argument so 
thoroughly, so absolutely, it literally willed evolution into being in the human consciousness. 
Once in plain site, evolution made its own case, of course. But today the writing that first fully 
described evolution is anything but an emptied vessel. 
Driving the rolling roads of Virginia, I've often daydreamed of a hard-bitten tobacco farmer two 
centuries back sitting down at a heavy oak kitchen table during some winter nights to read this 
English Nat'rlist's recently published account of how his own livestock changed over time. 
Darwin writes to make his case for this farmer. And for everyone. "Origin" is technical writing at 
its finest, writing about a concept so subtle and so complicated that it literally took the human 
race about 200,000 years to understand, and yet the writing is so clear that assumes no technical 
knowledge on the part from the reader, apart from basic fluency in the English language and 
some patience. 
Its oft been said that "Origin" is tedious to read. And it is true Darwin, in his eagerness to convey 
all the pertinent deets of this particular case at hand, could go on for a spell, sentence-wise. And 
at heart, he was a species geek, and can wallow happily on some arcane variation of an ant, bee 
or flower. 
Read through "Origin" as a case, one Darwin makes point by meticulous point, to a massive 
cathedral. Every sentence, however minute in concern, supports his argument.
