Origin of Species" as Technical Writing
We know species can vary over time: humans have been breeding animals for profit and pleasure 
since the dawn of civilization. 
We see how "the whole body of English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size 
the parent Arab stock," or how "how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early 
maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country." 
We also know that species will repopulate at a rate of geometric growth, until their numbers they 
consume all available resources. All species can reproduce faster than their members die off. The 
only thing keeping them in check is the limited number of resources. 
With only a limited number of resources, it is those variants of a species that are most 
successfully suited to extracting resources for survival that survive — and are around to breed 
the most. 
Natural selection takes place not only within species traits, but also across different species 
competing for the same resources. Those better at obtaining resources through new genetic traits, 
will, through time, overpower others. And there is a compound effect, the greater the diversity 
within the species, the more likely that species will be able to adapt that traits that make it better 
compete for resources. Those less able to compete become rarer, and, over time, go extinct. 
Natural selection is ruthlessly efficient. "Natural selection is continually trying to economize in 
every part of the organism," Darwin tells us. Any diminution of a trait that does not hinder the 
survival of the species will quickly be seized upon and capitalized. This may explain why there 
are very few species that thrive across different climates. 
Response to Criticism 
To this day, "Origin of Species" has generated a fair amount of skepticism, of which Darwin 
anticipated 
Chief among the criticisms is one of missing evidence: If natural selection modified all the 
species why don't we see more evidence of these earlier, or transitional, variations in the fossil 
record? He did admit that the geological record is spotty. "The crust of the earth is a vast 
museum; but the natural collections have been imperfectly made, and only at long intervals of 
time," he wrote. 
We do not have a record of transitional species, as they do not live for long, after the favorable 
variation of the species takes hold, and quickly comes to dominate. 
THOUGHTS:

Darwin piles on example after example variation under domestication, drawing from Chinese 
encyclopaedias, farmers and cattlemen, hobbyist animal breeders, gardeners, the Bible, even 
deriving them first-hand by breeding pigeons and studying the survival of weeds in a small field. 
Sometimes a piece of writing so closely describes the truth, that it itself becomes the truth. 
Charles Darwin's " On the Origin of Species," first published in 1859, made its argument so 
thoroughly, so absolutely, it literally willed evolution into being in the human consciousness. 
Once in plain site, evolution made its own case, of course. But today the writing that first fully 
described evolution is anything but an emptied vessel. 
Driving the rolling roads of Virginia, I've often daydreamed of a hard-bitten tobacco farmer two 
centuries back sitting down at a heavy oak kitchen table during some winter nights to read this 
English Nat'rlist's recently published account of how his own livestock changed over time. 
Darwin writes to make his case for this farmer. And for everyone. “Origin” is technical writing at 
its finest, writing about a concept so subtle and so complicated that it literally took the human 
race about 200,000 years to understand, and yet the writing is so clear that assumes no technical 
knowledge on the part from the reader, apart from basic fluency in the English language and 
some patience. 
Its oft been said that “Origin” is tedious to read. And it is true Darwin, in his eagerness to convey 
all the pertinent deets of this particular case at hand, could go on for a spell, sentence-wise. And 
at heart, he was a species geek, and can wallow happily on some arcane variation of an ant, bee 
or flower. 
Read through “Origin” as a case, one Darwin makes point by meticulous point, to a massive 
cathedral. Every sentence, however minute in concern, supports his argument. 
QUOTES AND PARAPHRASES:
Species that are most numerous will have the best chance of producing favorable variation.
"Rarity is the precursor to extinction" 
As new species are formed thru natural selection, others will become rarer & finally extinct.
The greater the diversity of the species, the better able to adapt to novel circumstances.
Geometric increase of species + Limited resources + Variation = Natural selection. 
All species are adapted to their own climate; few inhabit both very hot and very cold climates. 
Large beard, diminished waddles; Nature splurges in some places economizes in others. 
Natural selection economizes: it won't profit the individual to build up its nutrient in useless 
structure. 
The earth's crust is a vast museum, but its collections were taken at intervals of time vastly 
remote. 
Forms in greater numbers will almost always be favored owing to their greater variability.
No one yet has pinpointed how much divergence there would be between 2 species that would 
limit them from breeding.
Some closely related species don't breed hybrids at all while some distant species readily 
interbreed. 
The very process of natural selection constantly works to exterminate the parent and intermediate 
links.
A useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of 
no use. 
The more diversified the descendants, the better their chances at succeeding in the battle for life.
Natural selection often produces structures for the injury of other species, such as the fang of the 
adder 
While we don't see many transitional states in the fossil record, we should be cautious asserting 
that none existed  
Natural selection produces a perfection only according to the standard of the immediate environs.
It's a mistake to assume most instincts are generated by habit handed down to succeeding 
generations,
There is no fundamental difference between species and varieties.
Some cross breeding leads to vigorous new traits, though too extreme of cross-pollination will 
lead to sterility 
Sans numerous connecting links, “it may be objected that time will not have sufficed for so great 
an amount of organic change.” 
Natural Selection’s greatest weakness: The “extreme imperfection” of the geological record.
“The thickness & extent of sedimentary formations are the result & measure of the degradation 
which earth’s crust has elsewhere suffered.”
 “He who most closely studies ... the sea on our shores will ... be most deeply impressed with the 
slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away”
 “Our richest geological museums” have but a “paltry display”: Darwin on poor paleontological 
record of evolution 
Land rising from the sea will leave a great fossil variety; subsiding, breaking into the sea, it will 
leave little 
Where sediment under the sea did not accumulate quickly enough to protect bodies from decay, 
no remains can be found. 
During periods of subsidence, there will be much extinction of life. During the periods of 
elevation, much variation. 
“We do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have probably elapsed 
between our consecutive formations.” 
“Continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out; and clear and open oceans may 
have existed where our continents now stand.”
 “To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no 
satisfactory answer” 
“Of this volume only here & there a short chapter has been preserved. Of each page, only ... a 
few lines.” 
 “Species of different genre and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same 
degree.” 
Natural Selection: The belief that each variety/species survives by “having some advantage over 
those with which it comes into competition.”
Means of dispersal for Species: change of climate must have had a powerful influence on 
migration. 
The same species in distant points of the earth’s surface can be explained by each species having 
migrated from a single birthplace. 
He “who rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration & calls in the 
agency of a miracle” 
Dried hazelnuts floated for 90 days, and afterwards, when planted, they germinated; an asparagus 
plant for 23 days 
“I picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds. Some of them 
...  germinated.” 
Blown across vast distances by gales, birds can be highly effective agents in the transportation of 
seeds. 
Some habitual actions do become instinctual through inheritance 
“From the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to resemble each other in descending 
degrees.” 
 “A classification founded on any single character, however important that may be, has always 
failed.”

Wide ranging species not only crossed barriers but were “victorious in distant lands in the 
struggle for life.”

A mollusk on a duck foot can last 12-20 hours, the time it’d take the duck to fly 600 miles.

The less any part of the organization is concerned with special habits, the more important it is for 
classification

All true classification is genealogical; community of descent is the hidden bond naturalists have 
been seeking.
