“The White Album”
Joan Didion, 1979

NOTES:
This collection of essays, Joan Didion asserts almost immediately, are about the collapse of meaning. 
The narratives that are supposed to guide us through life. In the time that she penned them, western 
culture itself was shifting, giving way from old to young, from order to disorder. And on the personal 
level, her defense mechanisms were failing, a psychiatric evaluation from that time reported.
And like The Beatles album it is named after, this collection jumps around quite a bit, sometimes eluding 
narration and cohesion altogether. About her time living in a about-to-be-demolished Hollywood 
mansion through the late 1960s and early 1970s, the book itself lurches around her memories of the day 
– many pieces were snippets from magazine pieces she did at the time. One moment we are in the 
recording studio with The Doors, who seem to do almost nothing for hours at end. Soon after, we are 
bearing witness to the press testimony of Black Panther co-founder Huey Newton, just before he stood 
trial for the manslaughter of an Oakland police officer. What does it all mean? Didion defies us the make 
meaning.
