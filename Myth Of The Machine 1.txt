“Technics and Human Development: The Myth and the Machine Volume One”
By Lewis Mumford, 1966
http://amzn.to/2AQhpn1
Mumford wrote this book because because he could find “no clue to modern man’s overwhelming 
commitment to his technology,” and so he wanted to “re-examine the nature of man and the whole 
course of technological change.”

QUOTES
“With this new ‘megatechnics’ the dominant minority will create a uniform, all-enveloping, super-
planetary-structure, designed for automatic operation. Instead of functioning actively as an autonomous 
personality, man will become a passive, purposeless, machine-conditioned animal whose proper 
functions, as technicians now interpret man’s role, will either be fed into the machine, or strictly limited 
and controlled for the benefit of de-personalized, collective organizations.” P. 3 
“Our predecessors mistakenly coupled their particular mode of mechanical progress with an 
unjustifiable sense of increasing moral superiority.” P. 4
“More than a century ago Thomas Carlyle described man as a ‘tool-using animal,’ as if this were the one 
trait that elevated him above the rest of creation.” P. 5
“What is specially and uniquely human is man’s capacity to combine a wide variety of animal 
propensities into an emergent cultural entity: a human personality.” P. 6
“Early man’s hands and pebble tools played a significant part in his development, mainly because … they 
facilitated the preparatory functions of picking, carrying, and macerating food, and thus liberated the 
mouth for speech.” P. 6
“..the primeval repetitive order of ritual, a mode of order man was forced to develop, in self-protection, 
so as to control the tremendous overcharge of psychal energy that his large brain placed at his dispoal.”
“Every manifestation of human culture, from ritual and speech to costume and social organization, is 
directed ultimately to the remodeling of the human organism and the expression of the human 
personality.” P. 10
The remarkable thing about the rise of civilization “is that it was the result, not of mechanical 
inventions, but of a radically new type of social organization: a product of myth, magic, religion, and the 
nascent science of astronomy.” P. 11
“…cosmic order was the basis of this new human order.” P. 12
“Modern man has formed a curiously distorted picture of himself, by interpreting his early history in 
terms of his present interests in making machines and conquering nature.” P. 14
“In the realm of prehistory the generalist has a special office, that of bringing together widely separated 
fields, prudently fenced in by specialists, into a larger common area, visible only from the air.” P. 16
“It is wiser to assume … that Home sapiens fifty thousand years ago more closely represented ourselves 
than any remoter animal ancestor.” P. 22
“Our chief reason for over-rating the importance of tools and machines is that man’s most significant 
early inventions, in ritual, social organization, morals, and language, left no material remains…” p. 23
“With his highly organized nervous equipment, this brainy creature could take more risks than any other 
animal could afford, because he eventually had something more than the dumb animal insight necessary 
for correcting his inevitable mistakes and aberrations.”  P. 25
“The development of the central nervous system liberated man in large degree from the automatism of 
his instinctual patterns and his reflexes, and from confinement to the immediate environment in time 
and space.” P. 26
“The difference between the brain and the mind is surely as great as that between a phonograph and 
the music that comes forth from it.” P. 27
“Not how long you live, but how much you have lived, how much meaning your life has absorbed and 
passed on, is what matters.” P. 33
“It is only through the light of consciousness that the universe becomes visible, and should that light 
disappear, only nothingness would remain.” P. 33
“In short, without man’s cumulative capacity to give symbolic form to experience, to reflect upon it and 
re-fashion it, and project it, the physical universe would be as empty of meaning as a handless clock: its 
ticking would tell nothing. The mindfulness of man makes the difference.” P. 35
“In man, this pre-vision and pro-vision for the future becomes increasingly conscious and deliberate in 
dream images and playful anticipations, in the tentative trying out of imagined alternatives.” P. 44
“If survival were all that mattered to primitive man, he could have survived with no better equipment 
than his immediate hominid ancestors had possessed.” P. 45
 “Though dogs may dream, no dream ever taught a dog to imitate a bird or to behave like a God.” P. 49
“Creativity begins in the unconsciousness; and its first manifestation is the dream.” P. 50 
“It was a dream that opened man’s eyes to new possibilities in his waking life” P. 51
“Our highly mechanized Western civilization has many devices for limiting the province of the dream: 
we even canalize the subjective life into collective mechanisms like the radio and television, and let a 
machine do our dreaming for us.” P. 53
“From the dream, man got his first hint that there is more to his experience than meets the eye.” P. 54
“But the fact that tools, not just slivers, were produced shows that there is a counter-tendency in man, 
equally innate, and even more deeply, or at least more permanently, satisfying: the arts of creation and 
constructive organization, the deliberate forming of patterns, the putting together of ordered whole.” P. 
55
Savage pathology: “The formidable, irrational components that remain in civilized man’s own code of 
conduct.” P. 56
“Ungoverned creativity in science and invention has reinforced unconscious demonic drives that have 
placed our whole civilization in a state of perilous unbalance.” P. 57-58
