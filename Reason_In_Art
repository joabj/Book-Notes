"A will that never found anything to thwart it would think itself omnipotent " 

"There's a painful pregnancy in genius..." 

Any operation that humanizes and rationalizes objects is called art

"...Progress is art, bettering the conditions of existence." 

"The idiot can't learn from experience at all because a new process in his liquid brain doesn't modify structure."

"Sentimental physics": The ethical notion that happiness and freedom arise solely from hard labor 

If popular fancy finally sicken on games & fictions, it could find entertainment in the play of reality & truth 

"So utility leads to art when its vehicle acquires intrinsic value and becomes expressive" 

"Art needs to find a material relatively formless which its business is to shape." 

All instrumental arts, however indispensable, are burdens & should be abridged as much as possible

OTOH, "spontaneous action leads to art when it acquires a rational function." 

"To be absorbed by the incidental is the animal's portion, to be confined to the instrumental is the slave's..." 

Spontaneity "hurries [people] into wars and orgies, quite as it kindles sudden flaming visions in their brains."

The worst of tyrants the #spontaneous "exercises a needless & fruitless tyranny in the guise of duty & inspiration" 

"Barbaric musicians" too much carried away by their performance to "conceive its effects."\

Why idle notes can flow together harmoniously is as big a mystery as "the spirit's concern to keep a ... body alive" 

"Pure music is pure art, its extreme abstraction is balanced by its entire spontaneity"

When people take only to fashionable music you can bet what they are attracted to is the fashion, not the music. 

"The most abstract of arts serves the dumbest emotions"

The function of #art is to make life better, by depicting life as it actually is.


A reproduction established itself in the wake of death,representation confronted the dispersion born 
from experience
