NOTES:
This collection of essays, Joan Didion asserts almost immediately, are about the collapse of meaning. 
The narratives that are supposed to guide us through life. In the time that she penned them, western 
culture itself was shifting, giving way from old to young, from order to disorder. And on the personal 
level, her defense mechanisms were failing, a psychiatric evaluation from that time reported.
And like The Beatles album it is named after, this collection jumps around quite a bit, sometimes eluding 
narration and cohesion altogether. About her time living in a about-to-be-demolished Hollywood 
mansion through the late 1960s and early 1970s, the book itself lurches around her memories of the day 
- many pieces were snippets from magazine pieces she did at the time. One moment we are in the 
recording studio with The Doors, who seem to do almost nothing for hours at end. Soon after, we are 
bearing witness to the press testimony of Black Panther co-founder Huey Newton, just before he stood 
trial for the manslaughter of an Oakland police officer. What does it all mean? Didion defies us the make 
meaning. 
But a funny thing emerges: just as Fusion decries how the old narratives are breaking down, she, 
perhaps even knowingly, inevitably builds new ones from the rubble. It's not what she was supposed to 
remember  from her meeting with one of the Manson Killers , but her convos with the lawyer 
after...every detail, no matter how seemingly off topic, is up for grabs in a linear chain of understanding. 
What I learned from living in NYC  is that everyone makes their narrative . In the age if Instagram, it's 
nearly impossible The coverage of the  la protests that brought UCLA(?) Reveals everyone involved to be 
comfortable worth the strike,

Sticky Fingers: QUOTES/PARAPHRASES
 "...John Lennon still towered over Jann Wenner, who at 5'6", so often found himself gazing up at his 
heroes like a boy vampire." 
"As John Lennon would articulate it, for Wenner and Rolling Stone, 'rock n roll then was real. Everything 
else was unreal.'" 
"The psychedelic counterculture of San Francisco promised a revolution, one immune to capitalist 
forces." 
Jann Wenner was "the fan he purported to be, but that was only one side of him. Though he walked in-
step with the counterculture, he was also a Kennedy-worshipping preppy..."  
Jann Wenner "understood that, along with the drugs and freedom, there was fame, and also money."  
"For marketers, this new youth culture was uncharted territory and [Jann] Wenner was the pioneer." 
With the creation of Rolling Stone, founder Jann Wenner "made it safe for boys to ogle their male idols 
as rapturously as any girl might, by adding a healthy dose of intellectual pretense." 
Working with the same printer, Rolling Stone borrowed the Fleet Street fonts and the pinstripe columns 
of the recently defunct Ramparts Sunday magazine, setting it apart from the other willfully 
unconventional underground pubs of the day. Sticky Fingers
"That somebody had dared, bothered in the sentiment of the mainstream, to apply straight journalism 
to rock culture was a revelation."
Photographer Annie Leibowitz's  "intimacy with both Wenners [Jann and Jane] completed a triangle of 
ambition and pleasure that lay at the creative heart of Rolling Stone in the 1970s"
"For the first time in the history of man, young people had the money, the personal freedom, and the 
free time  to build monuments and pleasure palaces to their own taste."  - Tom Wolf on the 60s 
"'Being gay' said [Jann] Wenner, 'gave me a good and finer appreciation of the sexuality of the guys up 
there on the stage. I could understand ... how sexual this whole thing was.'" 
"It was the prickly celebrity tablet Us Weekly, [Jann Wenner's] last successful invention, highly lucrative 
but culturally toxic, that would barricade his flagging rock magazine against the collapse of both the 
record and the print industries." 
"From 1971 to 1977, Jann Wenner was the most important magazine editor in America, shepherding the 
generational plot lines of the 1960s into a rambling biweekly serial of rock n roll ..." 
"I quit everything and concentrated on making enough money so that when the kids grew up, we could 
have them psychoanalyzed" - Jann Wenner's mother 
Jann Wenner saw "LSD culture as virtuous precisely because it bypassed politics for an alternate reality." 
Visiting "The Melody Maker" in 1965, Jann Wenner was "astonished to see a working newsroom 
populated with reporters smoking cigarettes and talking shop, a vision of order and professionalism 
amid the decadence of Carnaby." 
"Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?" - Allen Ginsberg "America"  
"If Jann Wenner had a tail, it would always be wagging." -- Dotson Rader 
"The Dionysian energy of rock was destroying the old social forms and inventing a new value system 
around 'The sacred importance of love and truth and beauty and interpersonal relationships.'"- Ralph 
Gleason
"Forms and rhythms in music are never changed without producing changes in the most important 
political forms and ways." Plato, as quoted by Ralph Gleason to explain mid-1960s rock n roll 
"Despite the new age of freedom and self-expression, gay love was not part of the [late 60s] rock n roll 
menu." 
Crawdaddy was the first American rock n roll magazine, founded in 1966 by Paul Williams, and named 
after the club where The Rolling Stones got their start.
"When he first saw it, Mick Jagger was startled by the audacity of Rolling Stone: To name a newspaper 
after his band, and not even put The Rolling Stones on the cover of the first issue. It was an affront that 
would stick with Jagger for the next 50 years"
Paul Simon probably did his critical reputation widespread & untold harm in the mid-1960s by sleeping 
with a love interest of Jann Wenner. 
"When the inevitable blowback from a record label came, [Jann] Wenner would blame a writer or simply 
shrug. It was a cycle he was destined to repeat, fomenting controversy and then whistling past the 
ensuing storm." 
"Newsprint, which [Jann] Wenner saw merely as pragmatic until he could afford to become a 'slick,' 
gave Rolling Stone a street feel that made it more authentic than a rock exploitation magazine like 
Cheetah."  
"You can't explain to someone today how unique and essential those things were to the fiber of your 
being in those days." Bruce Springsteen quote on early rock n roll pubs Crawdaddy and Rolling Stone.
 "If Rolling Stone was a professional newspaper about rock n roll, the moment of truth was nigh. What 
did Jann Wenner really stand for? Was he a groupie? Or a fucking journalist?" On Altamont  
"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" was carved on the gravestone where Dickey Betts consummated an 
affair with the girlfriend of Boz Scaggs, who didn't find out until he read about it in a Rolling Stone 
interview with Duane Allman .... 
"There was a narcotic freedom to Rolling Stone as it charted the late 1960s, the primitive newsprint 
pages opening like a lotus flower, pedal by pedal, with revelations." 
"The proof that Rolling Stone was a great idea was that it survived [Jann] Wenner's management." - 
"... The working class primitivism of hard rock - Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath - which Wenner 
personally detested." 
Whenever Mick Jagger brought up Jann Wenner's name, said Marshall Chess, "It was always with a 
dismissive wave of the royal hand. 'He'll do whatever I want.'" 
Mick Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone's cover more than any other artist, 31 times, and "always a 
consistent seller"... 
Just a year after Altamont, Jann Wenner put Mick Jagger on the cover of Rolling Stone: "Wenner's staff 
was outraged that he bent his knee to the man Rolling Stone virtually implicated in a local murder." 
"In late 1969, Columbia [Records], whose suited executives were indistinguishable from IBM men, ran 
an ad campaign called 'But The Man Can't Bust Out Music,' imploring rock fans to reject the 
establishment by purchasing records from Columbia."
Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner "had long fiddled with the [record] reviews, tweaking them for 
personal and business reasons." 
"...But what it looked like in the underground press, and to staffers at Rolling Stone, was that Jann 
Wenner had just sold his newspaper to the record companies, while their readers were being shot dead 
in the streets of America." 
Had Hunter S. Thompson "never come along, Rolling Stone might have survived as a rock n roll trade 
paper, but instead it was about to become the most adventurous and ambitious newspaper-cum-
magazine of the 1970s." 
"Wenner had, in fact, cast off the youth revolution, such as it was. But it wasn't exactly a betrayal, 
because he had never subscribed to its political tenants in the first place."
For "Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas," Hunter S. Thompson "tried expensing a laundry list of drugs, 
alcohol, and even weapons paraphernalia to Rolling Stone."
Unlike any other Hunter S.Thompson gonzo writing before or after, "Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas" 
arrived fully-formed, "requiring little editing," Jann Wenner said.
"This was it! As I started reading the now-famous first sentences, I felt a crackle of electricity in the air ... 
This is going to change everything." - Chet Flippo on reading the original draft of Hunter S. Thompson's 
"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas." 
"The marriage of Jann and Jane had never been a conventional love. It was not so much sex that Jane 
craved from Jann Wenner as the thrust of his ambition." 
"At the time, tape-recording party talk was all the rage. As Lillian Roxon reported in the spring of 1971, 
her friends were all carefully saving and filing their cassettes for the great day when they could be 
released as social history." 
"The attention of a female with a camera was a powerful aphrodisiac for a male rock star." 
Annie Leibovitz could "intimidate people into getting naked" for the camera. If David Cassidy disrobed 
for her, why couldn't Peter Fonda?  
"The volume of what I witnessed, and saw, and photographed began to create me." 
"Leibovitz immediately fell under Jagger's spell, writing that he was the most elusive of her photographic 
muses."  
"At one point, [Truman] Capote describes the tour doctor recruiting 13 and 14 year old girls for sex play 
on the tour plane, with one such incident allegedly filmed for posterity by Robert Frank." 
Hunter S. Thompson's reportage was called "the most accurate and least factual" coverage of the 1972 
U.S. presidential campaign. 
"As he had been doing since 1967, Jann Wenner made puncturing Los Angeles egos a staple of his San 
Francisco newspaper." 
Jann Wenner "was, in effect, reframing rock n roll as a celebrity culture like any before it. It wasn't a 
movement or a youth culture any more, let alone a revolution. This was the age of personalities."
"Clive Davis was fired from CBS for allegedly charging his son's $20,000 Bar Mitzvah to the company 
expense account."
